# Simple Release-Please Example

This is a minimal example showing what you need for release-please:

1. **package.json** - with name and version
2. **CHANGELOG.md** - tracks release history
3. **Source code** - your application code (index.js)

That's it! Release-please will automatically:
- Create release PRs when you make conventional commits
- Update version numbers
- Update the CHANGELOG
- Create GitHub releases
